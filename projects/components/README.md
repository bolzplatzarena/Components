# Components

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.0. It includes
components for angular.

## Get started

This library uses the following tools / libraries:

- @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome
- @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
- @ngx-translate/core

The components are fully translatable but the configuration needs to be done by your own in you application or libray:

```
import * as en from './i18n/en.json';

export class AppModule {
  constructor(translate: TranslateService) {
    translate.setTranslation('en', en, true);
    translate.use('en');
  }
}
```

The example could be find in the repository.
